    This system will provide a user web-frontend to accommodate for
    many users, either on mobile or on desktop to have access to
    the system, aswell as building internal hardware which will
    display realtime data in front of specified facilities
    for students and professors to have direct access to crutial
    information about room occupancy and planing
